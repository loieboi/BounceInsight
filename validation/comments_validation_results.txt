- Significant higher t_ecc for the fp_data is the result of segmenting the fp_data too generous (i.e. too much data is included in the analysis)
    - This is the case for (eventually new segmentation):
        - 10_slowb1
        - 24_slownb1
        - 38_slowb1



- Wrong baseline crossings or non-existent baseline crossings which causes wrong t_ecc values:
    - 12_slowb2
    - 12_slowb3
    - 12_slownb1
    - 12_slownb2
    - 12_slownb3
    - 38_slownb2
    - 38_slownb3
